// Make sure the robot has the Color Sensor, then place it at a distance from a red object.
// Next, program the robot to move forward, continuously. The robot should only stop when
// the Color Sensor detects that red object.
// Note: Having the Color Sensor face downwards until it detects a red surface works just as fine.
