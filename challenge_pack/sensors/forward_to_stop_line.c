// Using a Color Sensor, program the robot to move forward until it detects a line!
// NOTE: This mini-challenge is a two-part challenge. Place a dark colored tape on
// a light colored surface. Start the robot away from the tape, then program the robot to
// move forward towards to tape, then stop when it detects it. Next, place a light colored
// tape on a dark surface, then program the robot to do that same behavior.
// In virtual worlds, two complete this activity correctly, you must do this activity from
// both starting points.
