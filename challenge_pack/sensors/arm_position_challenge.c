//For this challenge, use the regular VEX IQ Clawbot. Place the robot on a surface,
//and an object approximately 5 rotations' length away from the robot. Starting with
//the arm in the 'up' position, program the robot to lower its arm, move forward 5 rotations,
//grabbing onto the object, then bring it back to the starting location.
